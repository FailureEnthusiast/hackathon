## About 

TrackMyTruck is an IoT system that helps companies improve the health of truck drivers and reduce truck breakdown.

## The Problem We are Solving

Large corporations rely of their trucking fleet and spend over $10 billion annually on truck maintenence and driver health annually. Much of this cost is due to truck breakdown and disparities in driver health.  Because there is no real-time data to monitor indicators of truck maintenence and driver health, companies spend billions of dollars on avoidable costs related to poor driver health, truck breakdowns, and road accidents.  

## Users

#### Truckers

Our team interviewed 10 truck drivers their day-to-day duties and pain points driving. We found that truck driver health is a problem that centers on the lack of rest, sleep, exercise, and nutritious dietary options. Another pain point that we identified was the inconvenience of planning rest breaks in unfamiliar routes. 

#### Fleet Managers

Our team interviewed 3 fleet managers regarding improvements to fleet management. Respondents stated that repairs and maitenence were a huge cost to companies and impact timeliness of deliveries. 

## Our Innovative Technology

Our team has created a real-time IoT monitoring system using multiple sensors to track real-time truck maintenence data and driver rest break metrics. We have built a functional prototype of a multi-sensor device that sends metrics to a web dashboard in real-time. With our technology solution, companies with large trucking fleets will be able to save on the costs of reducing truck breakdowns and driver health hazards.

## The Trucking Market and Our Business Model

The U.S. trucking market is over $1.1 trillion and is growing 7.1% CAGR.
Within this market, fleet management technology spend is approximately $27 billion annually and is growing 10% CAGR.
Therefore, the market for our technology solution is large and growting.

We have created a business model that leverages subscription recurring revenue.

Our revenue streams include:

1) Monthly IoT Device Leasing Fee to Trucking Companies
2) Monthly Per User Subscription Fee Trucking Companies
3) Monthly Recurring Ad Revenue to Partners Such as Gas Stations, Restaurants, and Hotels

## Our Team

Our team is passionate and dedicated about improving the lives of truck drivers and reducing truck breakdown and accidents on the road. We are software engineers and designers that have driverse background in technology, education, and healthcare.
